  summary: dedent`
    Interested in learning Web Development but having trouble getting started?

    I wrote this book for the "me" of five years ago: the person who wants to know _how_ to become web developer. My path was convoluted, and inefficient: but yours does not have to be.

    Over the next 30 days, I show you how to navigate the sometimes confusing world of web development (_for free_). We'll walk all of the key ideas in web development, starting with the **very basics** and defining terms that are often skipped.

    By the end of this book, you will be able to make an educated decision about your future and understand the steps and commitment it will take to get there.
